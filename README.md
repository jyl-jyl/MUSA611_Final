(The website is not working currently because Heroku have canceled their free tier plans, however, I have created a similar app for the community-centered historic preservation for Carbondale, PA and here is a demo: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AIC2Jq3wQK2nJrsFEoR3I0exvfvC8Zl-/view?usp=share_link)

### Introduction: 
The 7th ward of Philadelphia is an area bounded by Spruce and South streets and extends from the 7th Street to the Schuylkill River. The ward was the heart of Philadelphiaâ€™s black and immigrant communities at the end of 19th century and was well documented by Dubois in his commissioned research by the university of Pennsylvania. In 1899, the University published his groundbreaking book, *The Philadelphia Negro*.

The 7th ward suffered from seiorus urban decline starting from the 50s because of the proposal of the Crosstown Expressway which would sweep off the whole neighbourhood. The expressway was not built, however, the ward was no longer a vibrant commercial corridor as it was.

Today, the former tenement homes and businesses of immigrant have been converted into trendy boutiques, chic restaurants, old row homes, and expensive new apartments. Because of its unique history, many buildings in the neighborhood used to house important institutions and are homes of famous residents. my app is aimed at improving the community engagement for preserving this unique history and the culture of the 7th ward of Philly.

### Aims of Website:
1. *Keep an inventory of all historic sites of the 7th ward.* The inventory should be open to any future changing and editing since the  documentation and the designation of historic sites is, and should be a danymic process. My class (students at Penn Historic Preservation Program) were actually working on the nomination of mltiple old buildings in the neiborhood and this website will be a great tool to collect information from both researchers in academia and community memeber about the history of the neighborhood.

2. *Allow people within the community to leave comments, memories, stories, audios and pictures on how they feel about a particular site.* A historic site should not only be stacks of files stored in the archive, it should be alive through the lens of people who are associated with it, physically and emotionally.
